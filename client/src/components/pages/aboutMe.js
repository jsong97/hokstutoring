In order to achieve this, I have decided to take up tutoring and on a fun note, create videos on tips and tricks to help you ace your Maths studies!<br/><br/>I have been tutoring for a year now and hope to keep this up for a longer time. My dream would be to see all my students achieve success in their maths endeavour (and possibly learn to enjoy maths along the way!)<br/><br/>Have a look around the website and maybe you might find a golden nugget or two.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Hok<br/></p>
